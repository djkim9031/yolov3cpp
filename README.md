# yolov3cpp
YOLOv3 custom training and inference using C++


Over the lunar new year I could work on migrating the code from Python to C++.
The compilier is simply the Visual Studio VSCC.
The open source libraries used are "opencv2" and "libtorch"

Features:
1. Custom training
2. Inference
3. Loading the pretrained YOLOv3 weights


TODO:
Training on GPU, distributed training. How to do it with libtorch? (under review)
